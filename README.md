- 👋 Hi, I’m Shubh. I'm a 3rd year undergrad currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science. I'm passionate about working toward the things that align with my interests.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in binge-watching anime and implementing machine learning models.
  
- Check out my portfolio at https://mishra-18.github.io
  
- 🌱 I've developed an interest analyzing data and performing machine learning tasks on it. My interest in deep learning stems from the 2nd semester of college when I got my hands on Deep Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI. Since then I've
     been coding and honing my skills.

-   Have a habit of reimplementing deep learning architecture from and prefer going through a few papers per semester.
  
- 💞️ I've worked on various projects ranging from End To end-to-end movie Recommendation Systems to Classification and Regression using deep learning models.


-  I'm also familiar with implementing projects with the help of docker 🐋 and google kubernetes engine, having multiple projects deployed on my hugging face spaces and GCP.
