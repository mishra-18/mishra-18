- 👋 Hi, I’m Shubh. I'm 3rd year undergrad currently persuing B.Tech in Computer Science. I'm passionate about working towards the things which align my interests.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in binge watching anime and implementing machine learning models.
  
- 🚬 Quoting Sherlock "*I may be on the side of AI but don't for one second think I don't know DSA.*"
  
- 🌱 I've developed my interest analysing data and perform machine learning task on it. My interest in deep learning stems from the 2nd semester of my college when I got my hands on Deep Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI. Since then I've
     been coding and honing my skills.

-   Have a habit of reimplementing deep learning architecture from and prefer going through a few papers per semester.
  
- 💞️ I've worked on various projects ranging from End To End Movie Recommendation System to Classification and Regression using deep learning models.


-  I'm also familier with implementing projects with the help of docker 🐋 and google kubernetes engine. I've also implemented projects on my hugging face spaces.
