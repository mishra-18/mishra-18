<h1 align='center'>Hey there! I'm Shubh 🌟 :></h1>

## 🚀 About Me

* I'm knee-deep in data 🌱, mining it for insights, and teaching machines to think deeper than a philosopher on espresso ☕.
* Currently, I'm wrangling Vision-language models into submission. They're still not listening.
  
* If you want to see a tech wizardry portfolio with more Easter eggs than a spring bunny convention, check out my [Protfolio](https://skmishra.netlify.app).
  
* 💞️ I love gaining deep insights from papers and implementing models from scratch with PyTorch.
* I'm interested in development of architectures and pipelines that help us gain deeper insights on how a particular model works and can be genenralized better on Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data.
* Follow me on [medium](https://medium.com/thedeephub/building-vision-transformer-from-scratch-using-pytorch-an-image-worth-16x16-words-24db5f159e27) where I explain how to implement some of the most influencial architectures from scratch.

- 🐋 Feel free to dive into my projects. They're Dockerized, ensuring no compatibility drama.

* For a sneak peek into my brain, check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xDHP1Md6XwTX444MQXT0wX6RKMuTDi-h/view?usp=sharing).
