- 👋 Hey there! I'm Shubh, a 3rd-year undergrad who thinks sleeping with my laptop might count as a LAN party. I'm earning my stripes in B.Tech Computer Science, and my mantra is 'Code, laugh, and caffeinate'.

  For a sneak peek into my brain, check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vYYKtzT85y_W0d7EH7IDBG2LF9BcAVX8/view?usp=sharing).
  
  Currently, I'm wrangling Vision-language models into submission. They're still not listening.

- 👀 Did you hear about the artificial intelligence that went to therapy? It said, 'I’ve got too many layers to unpack!'
PS: Crafting AI jokes is my neural network’s side hustle. Regrettable? Possibly. Hilarious? Digitally proven.

- 🌱 I'm knee-deep in data, mining it for insights, and teaching machines to think deeper than a philosopher on espresso. My love for deep learning started in the 2nd semester, and we've been going steady ever since!
  
- 💞️ I love gaining deep insights from papers and implementing models from scratch using PyTorch. I have read a bunch on both supervised and self-supervised algorithms (many implemented) and also have a Vision Transform series going on [medium](https://medium.com/thedeephub/building-vision-transformer-from-scratch-using-pytorch-an-image-worth-16x16-words-24db5f159e27) where I explain how to implement some of the important architectures from scratch.

- 🐋 Feel free to dive into my projects. They're Dockerized, ensuring no compatibility drama

☀️ If you have a problem in Windows 🪟 you have a troubleshooter. If you have a problem in Linux 🐧 you are the TroubleShooter.
